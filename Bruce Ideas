Notification holder, for all notifications (good for lockscreen and notification center maybe? Different sorts of displays needed though).
Would have different groups, handled by names of groups (app display names for the groups, or maybe bundle identifiers).
This way the view could be resized as needed.

Banner notifications handler
Time outs needed.
